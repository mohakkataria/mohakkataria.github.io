    <mark>TL;DR:</mark> do not enable <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code>.
</div>  

<p>If you have information regarding <code>TCP</code> states, then this article may be of use to you specifically if you are trying to debug an issue with dropped/timeout traffic involving <code>NAT</code> devices on cloud or own infrastructure alike. But if you are still not conversant with TCP much, read <a href="https://mohakkataria.github.io/tcp-connection-101/">Part-1</a> of this article which touches on the basics. <br />
</div></p>

<p>So this incident happened while my time (~November, 2016) at <code>Zomato</code> and we had enabled third party integrations for wallet based payment with <code>FreeCharge</code> for <code>Zomato Order</code>. I was looking after Payments@Zomato back then. We were having a setup wherein a lot(300+ per minute) of outbound connections, mostly wallet balance polling API calls to FreeCharge servers are made to update the Current Balance of a User Active on Zomato App in Online Ordering Flow. And we have a NAT device for all outbound traffic from our payment servers. So there are supposed to be  many TIME_WAIT sockets left in the system of active closer, as I described in my <a href="https://mohakkataria.github.io/tcp-connection-101/">last post</a> at any given time. Now in our case, FreeCharge was the active closer, and was dropping incoming connections from us  randomly, out of the 300+ calls we made to them every minute.</p>

<p>Now there a lot of guides/posts available on internet on tuning systems to allow for higher throughput which also involve changing <code>sysctl</code> configuration changes. And many of those guides would tell you to change the values of <code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> and <code>tcp_tw_reuse</code> to 1.</p>

<p>Now, the Linux kernel documentation is not very helpful about what <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code> does:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enable fast recycling <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets. Default value is 0. It should not be changed without advice/request of technical experts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse</code> is a little bit more documented but the language is near about the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allow to reuse <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint. Default value is 0. It should not be changed without advice/request of technical experts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The direct result of lack of documentation or information about the uses/drawbacks of changing such configuration values is that we find numerous tuning guides advising to set both these settings to 1 to reduce the number of entries in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. However, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp">tcp(7)</a> manual page states the issue about <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code> option clearly which is a problem hard to detect and waiting to bite you :  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enable fast recycling of <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets. Enabling this option is not recommended since this causes problems when working with NAT (Network Address Translation).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="content/images/2017/06/img_6690.png" alt="" title="" />  </p>

<p>So let's try to understand the problem now and try to correct other people on Internet. :)</p>

<h3 id="whatistcp_tw_recycleusedfor">What is <code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> used for ?</h3>

<p>There are mainly two reasons of using this option :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>While <code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> option significantly shortens the length of time that a socket must stay in the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state. But as we know from <code>TCP</code> Connection lifecycle, a socket in the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state is unable to accept a new connection until the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> period expires. Too many sockets in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> on a busy server can eventually cause <mark>port exhaustion</mark>, preventing any new connections from being formed until some of the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> periods expire.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> is able to provide the same protection which <code>TIME_WAIT</code> offers by making use of <mark>TCP Timestamps</mark>, specified in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt">RFC 1323</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, the active closer remembers the last timestamp value sent by the <mark>client’s IP address</mark>. If a new connection is received where the TCP timestamp is larger than the last recorded timestamp, then we can be sure that the packet is new, not an old duplicate. If the packet has a Timestamp value older than the last noted, then we can safely assume that the packet is from an old connection and should be deemed to be dropped. Technically, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a connection is closed actively, it MUST linger in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state for a time <code>2*MSL</code> (Maximum Segment Lifetime). However, it MAY accept a new <code>SYN</code> > from the remote TCP to reopen the connection directly from <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state, if it:</p>
  
  <p>(1) assigns its initial sequence number for the new connection to be larger than the largest sequence number it used on the previous connection incarnation, and</p>
  
  <p>(2) returns to <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state if the <code>SYN</code> turns out to be an old duplicate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="thefeudofnatwithtcp_tw_recycle">The feud of NAT with <code>tcp_tw_recycle</code></h3>

<p>As highlighted in previous section, the last seen timestamp is recorded per IP address. Now when multiple client machines are behind a <code>NAT</code>, it can pose a serious trouble, since all of them will have same source IP from server's point of view.</p>

<p>Moreover, TCP timestamp values are generated pseudo-randomly, so each device on the network will have a different timestamp value which can lead to some devices behind a shared IP address passing the <code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> test and others failing and being unable to connect. So, at the end it's all random, which somehow happened to be our case too, wherein out of the two machines which were behind the NAT device, requests from either of them C would fail in random fashion. To explain all this is a simple manner, let us consider the following example :</p>

<ul>
<li>Client 1 and 2 are behind a firewall with NAT.</li>
<li>Client 1 makes a successful web request to a WebServer A which has <code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> enabled. Note, that since NAT is enabled, for WebServer A, the request seem to come from Source IP of A, instead of either of client.</li>
<li>Let's say WebServer actively closes the connection after sending the necessary data. So the socket in question changes out of <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state and takes a note of the last TCP Timestamp it received from <code>NAT</code> device IP(since Client 1's IP is NAT'ed by the <code>NAT</code> device).</li>
<li>Now, if Client 2 tries to connect to the WebServer A by sending a <code>SYN</code> packet, and if its TCP timestamp value happens to be smaller than Client 1’s, the Timestamp value is compared to the previously seen timestamp by the WebServer A and on seeing that the new timestamp is smaller than the previous one, the <mark><code>SYN</code> is dropped</mark>.</li>
<li>Client 2 is unable to communicate with the WebServer until the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> period expires.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="howtofixit">How to fix it?</h3>

<pre><code>$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1  
</code></pre>

<p>Modify the value for the configuration in the file to 0. You need to have root access to do that.  </p>

<pre><code>$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf | grep tcp_tw_recycle
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 0

$ sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Since packets are dropped, the client is actually waiting for a response back until it times-out. And that is the same thing which was happening with us particularly. Random requests would start timing out and the problem would get fixed on its own after few seconds. And when we reached out to FreeCharge's team, they were unable to trace any calls to their application during that window, since the request never the application at the backend of the WebServer, the <code>SYN</code> packets were just being dropped. After careful research and help from Shrey Sinha(Head of Infrastructure @ Zomato) and FreeCharge's team, we were able to get the problem fixed.</p>
